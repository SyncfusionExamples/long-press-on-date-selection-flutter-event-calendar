# How to handle the long press action on date selection in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to handle the long press action on date selection in the Flutter Calendar.

The [onLongPress](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/calendar/callbacks#long-press-callback) callback in the Flutter Event Calendar can be used to handle the long press action on the date selection.

The onLongPress callback is called, whenever the SfCalendar elements are long pressed on view. By using the CalendarLongPressDetails you can get the long-pressed date, appointments, and element details when the long-press action is performed on an element in the calendar.

For more details, Refer to our UG documentation [Long press callback](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/calendar/callbacks#long-press-callback).
